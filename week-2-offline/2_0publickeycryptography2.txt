genesis block is the first block of the chain which doesnt have any transactions inside it

//How to transactions work on the blockchain?
Ref - https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/

User side
User first creates a public/private keypair
They create a transaction that they want to do (send Rs 50 to Alice).  The transaction includes all necessary details like the recipient's address, the amount and some blockchain specific parameters (for eg - latestBlockHash in case of solana)
They hash the transaction 
They sign the transaction using their private key
They send the raw transaction , signature and their public key to a node on the blockchain.

Miner
Hashes the original message to generate a hash
Verifies the signature using the users public key and the hash generated in step 1
Transaction validation - The miner/validator checks additional aspects of the transaction, such as ensuring the user has sufficient funds
If everything checks out, adds the transaction to the block


//Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallet

Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets are a type of wallet that can generate a tree of key pairs from a single seed.  
This allows for the generation of multiple addresses from a single root seed, providing both security and convenience.
(seed phrase: we get at the time of wallet creation)
example: 

book 
fit 
fly 
ketchup 
also 
elevator 
scout 
mind 
edit 
fatal 
where 
rookie

Problem 
You have to maintain/store multiple public private keys if you want to have multiple wallets. 

Solution - BIP-32
Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 32 (BIP-32) provided the solution to this problem in 2012. 
It was proposed by Pieter Wuilla, a Bitcoin Core developer, to simplify the recovery process of crypto wallets. 
BIP-32 introduced a hierarchical tree-like structure for wallets that allowed you to manage multiple accounts much more easily than was previously possible.
Itâ€™s essentially a standardized way to derive private and public keys from a master seed.

//Hashing vs encryption

Hashing
Hashing is a process of converting data (like a file or a message) into a fixed-size string of characters, which typically appears random. 
ex: chetan=> be68877fa734f7f75a4f8aa19dea8744edd6d3bea3d00efcfcad44a1be1cbae3
Common hashing algorithms - SHA-256, MD5

Encryption
Encryption is the process of converting plaintext data into an unreadable format, called "ciphertext", using a specific algorithm and a key.
The data can be decrypted back to its original form only with the appropriate key.
Key Characteristics:
Reversible: With the correct key, the ciphertext can be decrypted back to plaintext.
Key-dependent: The security of encryption relies on the secrecy of the key.
Two main types:
Symmetric encryption: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
Asymmetric encryption: Different keys are used, for encryption (public key) and decryption (private key).

symmetric encryption:

chetan +"key" (encryption)=> be68877fa734f7f75a4f8aa19dea8744edd6d3bea3d00efcfcad44a1be1cbae3 +"key" (decryption)= chetan

Asymetric encryption:
chetan +"private key" (encryption)=> be68877fa734f7f75a4f8aa19dea8744edd6d3bea3d00efcfcad44a1be1cbae3 +"public key" (decryption)= chetan

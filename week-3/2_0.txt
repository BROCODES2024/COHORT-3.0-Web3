Wei, Lamports
# ETH

**Wei**:

- **Definition**: Wei is the smallest unit of cryptocurrency in the Ethereum network. It's similar to how a cent is to a dollar.
- **Value**: 1 Ether (ETH) = 10^18 Wei.

**Gwei**

- **Definition**: A larger unit of Ether commonly used in the context of gas prices.
- **Conversion**: 1 Ether = 10^9 gwei

## Lamports

- In the Solana blockchain, the smallest unit of currency is called a **lamport**. Just as wei is to Ether in Ethereum, lamports are to SOL (the native token of Solana).
- 1 SOL = 10 ^ 9 Lamports
//code
const { LAMPORTS_PER_SOL } = require("@solana/web3.js")

console.log(LAMPORTS_PER_SOL)
***crypto is stored in blockchains as wei or lamport as programming languages are not optimal with decimals so if we nedd to store 100.10 rupees blockchain stores as 10010 paise***
# RPC Server


An RPC server provides a way for external clients to interact with the blockchain network. RPC stands for **Remote Procedure Call**, and an RPC server exposes an API that allows clients to send requests and receive responses from the blockchain.

An RPC server is a service that listens for JSON-RPC requests from clients, processes these requests, and returns the results. It acts as an intermediary between the blockchain and external applications or services.

ðŸ’¡ An RPC (Remote Procedure Call) server is not inherently part of the blockchain network itself, nor does it participate in staking or consensus mechanisms

You can grab your own RPC server from one of many providers -

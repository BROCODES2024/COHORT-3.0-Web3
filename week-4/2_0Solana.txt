# Accounts on Solana

### Accounts

On the Solana blockchain, an "account" is a fundamental data structure used to store various types of information.

1. **Data Storage**: Accounts on Solana are used to store data required by programs (smart contracts) or to maintain state
2. **Lamports**: Accounts hold a balance of Solanaâ€™s native cryptocurrency, lamports. Lamports are used to pay for transaction fees and to rent the space that the account occupies on the blockchain.     
3. **Programs:**  On Solana, programs are special accounts that contain executable code. These accounts are distinct from regular data accounts in that they are designed to be executed by the blockchain when triggered by a transaction.

usually we worry about(on Solana):
lamports
data
executable
owner/assigned program id
rent


Rent on solana:
there are multiple miners on blockchain, but if we want to run smartcontracts/programs on the chian we need to pay rent or else everyone would like to use the blockchain

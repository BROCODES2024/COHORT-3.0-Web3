how does walltet show balance:
user send request to rpc(remote procedure call) which interact with blockchain and used to send requests (can send req using postman)
the above process is used in Mainnet,Devnet,Testnet

Mainnet: The real Blockchain deploy here only if everything is perfect as it involves real soalana and real Blockchain (we cant run development here as it requires real solana for rent)
Devnet: This is a dummy blockchain which have very little no of miners(developers), its used for development purposes we can airdrop(free solana) solana in this which obviously we wont be able to sell/buy
Testnet: This is just for local machine development(ie only you)( to run this use solana-test-validator)

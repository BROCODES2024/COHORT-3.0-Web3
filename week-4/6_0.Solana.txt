solana token program: 
usdt,tether,bonk,daddy,pepe are kind of tokens which are bulit on solana token program or etherum token program they dont have their own blockchain ie their own miners.
usdt,tether,bonk,daddy,pepe are just a kind of smart contracts on eth/sol token program
etherum token program is ERC-20

so if we want to create our own toekn we need to mint a token on solana token program and then enter the market
and then we can create our own accounts for usdc,usdt etc from token mint

# Creating a token
Creating `your own token` (100x coin lets say) requires understanding the `Token Program` that is written by the engineers at Solana - https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library

Specifically, the way to create a `token` requires you to 

1. Create a token mint
2. Create an `associated token account` for this mint and for a specific user
3. Mint tokens to that user.

### Token mint

It’s like a `bank` that has the athority to create more coins. It can also have the authority to `freeze coins`.

### Associated token account

Before you can ask other people to send you a token, you need to create an `associated token account` for that token and your public key

Reference - https://spl.solana.com/token 
##solana commands:
Create a new cli wallet
solana-keygen new
​
Set the RPC url
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
​
Airdrop yourself some SOL
solana airdrop 1
​
Check your balance
solana balance
​
Create token mint
spl-token create-token (spl : solana program library)
//as soon as we call this a request is sent to RPC which is furthur sent to blockchain and now blockchain mints the token

spl-token create-token --decimals 4
ie we can send up to 10 decimals ie 0.0001
by default decimals is 9

if decimal is 0 its a NFT ie we should send the whole (we cant send an decimal NFT)

Check the supply of the token
spl-token supply AQoKYV7tYpTrFZN6P5oUufbQKAUr9mNYGe1TTJC9wajM(token mint address)

Create an associated token account
spl-token create-account ChNkv9iW5pZJ1YAsNswC2CrdMUkFJBUbRWinjdLvKpXA(token mint address)
(we can create an account for the address (which we get using solana address) on this token(the above token address) by using this command )

Mint some tokens to yourself
spl-token mint  ChNkv9iW5pZJ1YAsNswC2CrdMUkFJBUbRWinjdLvKpXA 100

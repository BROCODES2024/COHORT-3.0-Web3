What is a Dapp?
Decentralized Application
A DApp (Decentralized Application) is an application that runs on a blockchain or peer-to-peer (P2P) network instead of a single centralized server. 
Unlike traditional apps, DApps are open-source, transparent, and censorship-resistant, making them a key part of decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, social media, and other blockchain-based solutions.
